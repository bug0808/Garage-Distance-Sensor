# Garage
WebServer for garage door management. 
Given direction from law enforcement NOT to have a garage door opener in your car it is convenient to have a way to open a close your garage door from your driveway.
Chances are your wifi extends out to your driveway!
This simple little project uses an ESP32 to host a webpage and to run a relay that is connected to your garage door opener.
By connecting to the webpage from your phone you can pulse the door to either open or close.
